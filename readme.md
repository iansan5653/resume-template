# HTML/CSS Resume Temnplate

Here's a simple template for building a resume in pure HTML / CSS. This will result in a basic one-pager that you can easily print to PDF and/or upload to GitHub Pages for sharing. It's designed to be dense, but readable.

As an example usage of this template, here's my own resume: https://iansan5653.github.io/resume/

## Instructions

The template is pretty straightforward. Edit `index.html` to get started. Semantic HTML and class names are used for styling - feel free to add more items, delete items, reorder things, etc. Customize to your heart's content. To adust the styling and theme, edit `styles.css`.

Tip: use the "Live Preview" feature in VSCode to see the resume as you edit.
